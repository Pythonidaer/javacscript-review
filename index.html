    <p>
      Chrome DevTools is a powerful set of tools that allows you to inspect,
      debug, and profile your JavaScript code in real-time. To debug issues with
      your JavaScript code, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Open DevTools: Press F12 or right-click on the webpage and select
        "Inspect" from the context menu. You can also use Ctrl + Shift + I (or
        Cmd + Option + I on macOS) to open it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Navigate to the "Sources" tab: In DevTools, go to the "Sources" tab to
        see the list of all loaded scripts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set breakpoints: Click on the line number of the code where you want to
        pause the execution (you'll see a blue marker). When the code runs and
        reaches that point, it will pause, and you can inspect variables, step
        through the code, and see what's going wrong.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inspect variables and call stack: While the code is paused, you can
        hover over variables to see their values, view the call stack to
        understand the function call hierarchy, and use the control buttons
        (step into, step over, step out) to navigate through the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Console: You can also use the Console tab to execute JavaScript commands
        directly and inspect any logged output or errors.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Debugging Memory Leaks</h2>
    <p>
      Memory leaks can be challenging to debug but using Chrome DevTools can
      make it easier to identify the cause. Here are the steps to help you debug
      memory leaks:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Take heap snapshots: Go to the "Memory" tab in DevTools and click the
        "Take snapshot" button to capture the heap's current state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compare snapshots: Interact with your web application and perform
        actions that you suspect might cause memory leaks. Take additional
        snapshots after each interaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compare heap snapshots: After taking multiple snapshots, select two
        snapshots to compare and click the "Comparison" button. DevTools will
        highlight the objects that increased in memory usage between the two
        snapshots, helping you identify potential leaks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Retaining paths: For each suspicious object, you can use the "Retaining
        Paths" feature to see what's keeping that object in memory, helping you
        pinpoint the cause of the leak.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Debugging Performance</h2>
    <p>
      To optimize the performance of your JavaScript code, DevTools provides
      several tools:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Performance Profiler: Go to the "Performance" tab and click the record
        button to start profiling. Interact with your web application to capture
        performance data. After stopping the recording, you'll get a detailed
        breakdown of CPU usage, loading times, and bottlenecks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Network Panel: The "Network" tab helps you analyze network requests,
        response times, and potential issues that might affect the performance
        of your web application.
      </li>
      <li>
        Audits: The "Audits" tab allows you to run automated tests and get
        suggestions for improving performance, accessibility, and other best
        practices.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Remember, using these tools effectively requires practice and familiarity,
      so don't hesitate to experiment and explore different features in Chrome
      DevTools to become proficient at debugging JavaScript issues, memory
      leaks, and performance bottlenecks. Happy debugging!
