    <h1>Modules in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>There are 2 main ones in JavaScript</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>CommonJS:</strong><br />
        <p>
          CommonJS is a module specification that was primarily used in
          server-side environments like Node.js before ECMAScript Modules (ES
          Modules) were introduced. The CommonJS format uses require() to import
          modules and module.exports or exports to export functionality from a
          module.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main drawbacks of CommonJS is that it's synchronous,
          meaning the modules are loaded and executed synchronously, which could
          cause performance issues in certain scenarios.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ECMAScript Modules:</strong><br />
        <p>
          ECMAScript Modules, also known as ES Modules or simply import/export,
          are the standard module system introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in
          2015. Unlike CommonJS, ES Modules are natively supported in modern
          browsers and Node.js versions, making them more widespread.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use ES Modules in a JavaScript file, you need to use the
          <em>import</em> statement to <em>import</em> functionality from other
          modules and the <em>export</em> keyword to
          <em>export</em> functionality from a module.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      In summary, CommonJS and ECMAScript Modules are both used to organize and
      manage code in JavaScript, but ES Modules have become the standard due to
      better performance, native support, and static analysis capabilities. When
      working with modern JavaScript projects, you'll likely come across ES
      Modules more frequently.
