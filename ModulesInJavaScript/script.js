// Uncaught ReferenceError: module is not defined
/*
The error message "Uncaught ReferenceError: module is not defined" typically occurs when you are trying to use the module object or the exports object in a JavaScript file that is not being treated as a CommonJS module. This error commonly arises in front-end environments like browsers, which do not have built-in support for CommonJS modules.

Using CommonJS syntax in a browser:
If you are using CommonJS syntax (e.g., require() or module.exports) directly in a browser environment without any bundler or module loader, you will encounter this error because browsers do not natively support CommonJS modules.

Solution: To fix this issue, you need to either switch to ECMAScript Modules (ES Modules) syntax (using import and export) or use a bundler like Webpack or a module loader like RequireJS to handle CommonJS modules in the browser.

ES Modules support asynchronous module loading, which can lead to better performance and reduced initialization time in certain scenarios. They also have static analysis, which means imports are determined before code execution, making it easier for tools to optimize the module loading process.

In the context of JavaScript development, a bundler or module loader is a tool or utility that helps manage the organization, loading, and execution of JavaScript modules in a project. Both bundlers and module loaders are used to address the challenges of working with modular code, especially in larger projects with multiple files and dependencies.

Bundler:
A bundler is a tool that takes multiple JavaScript files, along with their dependencies, and bundles them together into a single optimized and concatenated file. The bundler's primary purpose is to reduce the number of HTTP requests required to load the application and improve the overall performance by minimizing the file size and utilizing advanced optimizations, like tree-shaking and code minification.
Popular JavaScript bundlers include:

Webpack: Webpack is one of the most widely used bundlers and is highly configurable. It can handle not only JavaScript but also other assets like CSS, images, and more.

Parcel: Parcel is a zero-configuration bundler, making it straightforward to set up and use.

Rollup: Rollup is known for its tree-shaking capabilities, which can significantly reduce the bundle size by removing unused code.

Module Loader:
A module loader is responsible for loading and executing JavaScript modules at runtime. It allows you to define and import modules using standard syntax (e.g., import and export statements) without the need for manual bundling. The module loader dynamically fetches and loads the required modules as needed, making it suitable for applications with a more dynamic module loading pattern.
In modern browsers and environments that support ECMAScript Modules (ES Modules), the module loader is built-in and automatically handles the loading of ES Modules. This means you can use import and export directly in your code without needing an additional module loader.

However, in environments that don't support ES Modules (e.g., older browsers or Node.js versions without native ES module support), you may need to use a separate module loader or a bundler that can handle module loading.

Popular JavaScript module loaders include:

SystemJS: SystemJS is a universal module loader that can load modules written in various formats, including AMD, CommonJS, and ES Modules.

RequireJS: RequireJS is primarily used for loading AMD modules, but it can also handle CommonJS modules with plugins.

SystemJS and RequireJS are most commonly used when working with non-native ES Modules environments or when needing to support older codebases that use different module formats.

In summary, both bundlers and module loaders are essential tools in modern JavaScript development. Bundlers optimize and bundle code for production, while module loaders handle the loading and execution of JavaScript modules at runtime, making modular development more accessible and efficient.
