    <h1>Memory Management in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      Memory management is a critical aspect of any programming language,
      including JavaScript. It refers to the process of allocating and
      deallocating memory to store data and execute code efficiently. JavaScript
      uses a memory management system that automatically handles memory
      allocation and deallocation, known as "Garbage Collection."
    </p>
    <h2>Memory Lifecycle in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, the memory lifecycle involves several stages when dealing
      with data:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Allocation: When you create a variable or an object, memory is allocated
        to store its data. For example, when you declare a variable like
        <code>let x = 10;</code>, memory is allocated to store the value 10.
      </li>
      <li>
        Usage: During the execution of your code, you can read and modify the
        values stored in variables and objects. These operations occur in the
        allocated memory space.
      </li>
      <li>
        De-allocation: When a variable or object is no longer needed or goes out
        of scope, it becomes eligible for memory deallocation. This means the
        memory it occupies can be released and made available for other data.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory that
      is no longer in use or unreachable in a JavaScript program. When objects
      or variables are no longer referenced or reachable from the execution
      context, they are considered "garbage," as they serve no purpose in the
      program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JavaScript engine periodically performs garbage collection to find and
      clean up this unused memory. The exact algorithms and timings for garbage
      collection can vary between different JavaScript engines (e.g., V8 in
      Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox). However, most engines use a combination
      of techniques to manage memory efficiently, such as:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Reference Counting: This technique keeps track of the number of
        references to an object. When the reference count drops to zero, meaning
        no variables or objects reference it, the memory associated with the
        object is freed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mark and Sweep: This is a more common garbage collection algorithm. It
        involves two main steps: marking and sweeping.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Mark: The garbage collector marks all the objects that are still
            reachable from the root context (global variables, function scopes,
            etc.). Any objects not marked are considered garbage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sweep: Once all reachable objects are marked, the garbage collector
            sweeps through the memory, releasing the memory occupied by unmarked
            (garbage) objects.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
