    <h1>ESLint</h1>
    <p>
      ESLint is a popular open-source static code analysis tool for JavaScript.
      It is used to identify and report patterns or code practices in your
      JavaScript code that might be problematic, inconsistent, or prone to
      errors. ESLint checks your code against a set of configurable rules and
      provides feedback on potential issues, violations of coding standards, and
      best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some key reasons why you should consider using ESLint in your
      JavaScript projects:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Code Quality Improvement:</strong> ESLint helps maintain
        consistent and high-quality code across your project. It enforces coding
        standards and style guidelines, reducing the chances of introducing bugs
        and improving overall code readability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Error Prevention:</strong>ESLint can catch common programming
        errors, such as typos, undeclared variables, and incorrect use of
        language features. By identifying these issues early, you can prevent
        them from causing runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customizable Rules:</strong> ESLint allows you to configure and
        customize rules based on your project's specific requirements. You can
        enable, disable, or modify rules to suit your team's coding standards
        and preferences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Integration with Development Tools:</strong> ESLint integrates
        seamlessly with code editors and build systems. Many modern code editors
        (e.g., Visual Studio Code) have ESLint extensions that provide real-time
        feedback and highlighting of issues as you write code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enforce Best Practices:</strong> ESLint encourages the adoption
        of best practices in your JavaScript code. It helps you identify
        anti-patterns and provides suggestions for better alternatives, leading
        to more maintainable and performant code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Automated Code Reviews:</strong> Incorporating ESLint into your
        development workflow allows you to automate code reviews. This saves
        time and effort, as developers can receive feedback on potential issues
        instantly, rather than waiting for manual code reviews.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> ESLint promotes consistency and
        collaboration within development teams. All team members follow the same
        coding standards, making it easier to read, understand, and contribute
        to each other's code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ESNext Support:</strong> ESLint supports the latest ECMAScript
        (ESNext) features, allowing you to adopt modern JavaScript syntax and
        features while ensuring code quality and compatibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Community and Extensibility:</strong> ESLint has a large and
        active community, providing ongoing support and regular updates.
        Additionally, you can extend ESLint with custom plugins and share them
        with the community, allowing you to tailor it to your project's unique
        needs.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Synchronous Code</h2>
    <p>Executed Sequentially, one line after another</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Asynchronous programming in JavaScript became more important with the rise
      of web development and the need for handling non-blocking operations like
      fetching data from servers or handling user interactions without freezing
      the UI.
    </p>

    <h4>setTimeout</h4>
    <p>
      A function in JavaScript that allows you to schedule the execution of a
      function after a specified delay (in ms). It is a simple way to introduce
      asynchrony into your code
    </p>
    <h4>setInterval</h4>
    <p>
      Another function that repeatedly executes a function with a fixed interval
      between each execution
    </p>

    <h2>Event Loop</h2>
    <p>
      The Event Loop is responsible for managing asynchronous tasks and ensuring
      that they are executed efficiently. Here's how it works:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Main Thread Execution:</strong> JavaScript code runs on the main
        thread and processes tasks synchronously, one after another.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Asynchronous Operations:</strong> When an asynchronous operation
        (e.g., an API request) is encountered, JavaScript does not block the
        main thread waiting for the operation to complete. Instead, it delegates
        the operation to the browser (in the case of web browsers) or the
        environment (in the case of Node.js).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Callback Queue:</strong> Once the asynchronous operation is
        completed, the result is placed in the Callback Queue (also known as the
        Task Queue). This queue contains callback functions that should be
        executed as soon as the main thread is free.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Event Loop:</strong> The Event Loop continuously checks the
        Callback Queue. If the main thread is idle (i.e., there are no
        synchronous tasks being executed), the Event Loop picks the first task
        from the Callback Queue and executes its corresponding callback
        function.
      </li>
    </ol>
